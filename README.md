# Live Face-Based Vitals Monitoring System

This project is a real-time system for estimating human vital signs from a live webcam feed using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) method. It analyzes facial video, extracts a blood volume pulse (BVP) signal, and calculates Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Stress Index, SpO2, and Respiratory Rate.

The core of the system is a deep learning model (TS-CAN) combined with robust signal processing and a dynamic user interface.
